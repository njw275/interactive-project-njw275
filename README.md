# Interactive-Project
This project is due Monday, February 19th.

## Prompt
Come up with some project call that you have been awarded. Perhaps you got awarded the job of coming up with a system that allows people to use gestures in their home to activate/deactivate various appliances/lights/etc. Or perhaps you got awarded the job to create a system that tracks and understands museum vistor movements in a space and triggers various sounds, visuals, and/or something else in an interactive installation. Or perhaps you were awarded a project tasked with building an interface for a new musical instrument, or maybe a game project, or.... (fill in the blank). This project could take many forms, but needs to include realtime machine learning trained with one or more sensors, and some sort of output. Be as detailed as possible about the project call, what is the setting, what the input should be, what the output should be, etc. Don't start thinking about the tech first, think about the thing you want to create first. After that, then think about what tools are needed for building the project.

## Expectations
This project is one of the 4 major projects due during the semester and should be much more developed and polished than the weekly exercises. Having said that, it doesn't have to be an enterprise solution, it can certainly be at a proof of concept stage. As mentioned above, you have to use some sort of machine learning as a processing step between your input and your ouput. However, that doesn't have to be limited to Wekinator strictly. You are free to use other platforms if you prefer. If you have questions about what I will consider as "Machine Learning", please ask. 

The documentation for this project should be more much detailed as well. Take videos/pictures every step of development, so you can tell a story later. You're documentation should include whatever other informative information you can provide as well, like sketches, text, diagrams, etc. We will do user testing in class. Your documentation should address your user testing feedback. You don't have to accept all user testing feedback, but you should explain why you did not. Your original proposal should be included in your documentation as well.

Push all code and assets needed to run your project to your repo. You should also include detailed instructions on how to set up and operate your project.
